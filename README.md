COMP 20 Spring 2015 Private Repo for Eric Peterson

Lab 9: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
    The purpose of this Git repository is to have a private, secure, and persistant
    place to work on my assignments, track my changes, and present them for grading
    by Ming.
2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
    My favorite assignment was by far the server-side assignment. I think that
    it is really interesting working with databases, and creating an API. Personally.
    I don't love front-end development, and am much more interested in using data
    in smart ways to piece together an API and backend product.

    Also, I really enjoyed learning how to create my own server, and deploy basic
    products to a public resource like heroku. 

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
    I feel like I have grown a lot as a web developer. While I feel that I am a
    strong programmer, I was not exposed to coding by learning from internet 
    resources, and piecing together libraries and packages from the open source
    community. Even reading documentation was very foreign to me, and having
    both created and used APIs was incredibly beneficial to my growth.

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
    I think the most important things I learned in this course were also my 
    favorite - the server side development topics.

    First, I think learning how to deploy apps to heroku is incredibly valuable,
    especially if I hope to do any public computing in the future.

    Second, I think that learning how to create API endpoints on an app that can 
    respond to queries by checking a database is also great. On my final project,
    I created (and am finishing) an API that lets friends build recipes together,
    and that's been really fun.

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
    I would like to delve deeper into some of the back-end. This would include
    frameworks that use the MVC rendering methods. Also, I think learning how 
    to use hosting services like amazon web services would be great, because
    if I ever want to build something that scales as usage increases those
    products are extremely useful.

    If I weren't graduating, I would totally take comp120!

Thanks for everything Ming, it's been a great semester!
