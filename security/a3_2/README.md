# Assignment 3: The Server for the Real Marauder's Map

1. I believe I have implemented all aspects of the assignment correctly. I would have liked to add more error handling but as far as I can tell, there should be nothing that totally crashes the server.

2. Collaborated with nobody.

3. Spent approximately 8 hours total.
